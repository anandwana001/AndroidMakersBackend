The answer is Compose Runtime. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will see how we can use Compose Runtime to create client libraries. Firstly, we will talk about Compose nodes, Composition, Recomposer, and how they are orchestrated to create a slot table. Then, we will see how the changes in the slot table are applied with an Applier. Moreover, we will touch upon the Snapshot system and how the changes in the state objects trigger a recomposition. Finally, we will create a basic UI toolkit for PowerPoint using Compose Runtime.",

Hopefully this will make the daily life easier for all the Android developers working on system applications.",

However, as our codebase grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure that all developers are following the same coding standards.

Lint can save us hours of debugging time by identifying issues early on. But did you know that you can also create your own custom Lint rules?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll dive deep into the world of Android Lint and explore how to create custom rules that fit our specific needs. We'll cover the basics of how Lint works, the different types of rules that we can create, and some practical examples of how to use Lint to improve code quality at scale.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use Android Lint to improve code quality and productivity on your projects. You'll be equipped with the knowledge to create your own custom rules and ensure that your codebase is clean and maintainable at all times.",

      "description": "Depuis la publication de la première version stable Jetpack Compose il y a près de 2 ans, l’intérêt pour cette technologie n’a fait qu’augmenter, et son adoption dans les nouveaux projets est une évidence. Cependant, son intégration dans des projets ayant des codebases conséquentes et anciennes est une autre affaire.\r\n\r\nChez Deezer, nous travaillons depuis plusieurs années avec un Design System afin d’améliorer la productivité et la consistance de nos projets. Aussi, la synergie entre Compose et les Design Systems, grâce à la composition, nous est apparue comme une excellente opportunité pour accélérer nos futurs développements et créer de nouvelles interfaces saisissantes. Nous avons, par conséquent, établi une stratégie afin de migrer notre Design System et utiliser Compose pour nos nouvelles implémentations, mais aussi de migrer nos fonctionnalités existantes. En voici les différentes étapes : \r\n- Migration d'une page existante afin de monter en compétence sur les nouveaux paradigmes introduits par Compose\r\n- Définition d’une roadmap visant à initier un nouveau Design System en Compose, en suivant les principes de l’Atomic Design\r\n- Conception de l’API de nos composants afin de les rendre à la fois flexibles et réutilisables, notamment sur l’usage d’API par “slot” ou encore de modèles pour les composants UI\r\n- Spécifications des guidelines et standards, à la fois pour l’usage du nouveau Design System mais aussi pour les nouveaux développements en Compose\r\n\r\n\r\nNotre retour d'expérience vous permettra de découvrir différentes solutions, de mieux comprendre les pièges à éviter (dans lesquels nous sommes parfois tombés), et d’imaginer quelle stratégie adopter pour migrer vos propres applications en Compose.\r\n",

      "description": "Secrets like API keys, security certificates and other credentials are the crown jewels of our applications. They give access to our most sensitive information and systems like databases, cloud infrastructure and third-party services. Despite being highly sensitive, these secrets are being leaked in our source code and compiled mobile applications. \r\n\r\nThroughout the presentation, we will analyze two in-depth research projects to show how mobile applications and specifically android applications are leaking secrets. The presentation will be broken into three sections:\r\n\r\n**Part 1 - How attackers find and exploit secrets**\r\nWe break down a collection of real-life breaches where hackers discovered and exploited credentials to gain unlawful access to different services. How the credentials were discovered, how they were exploited, and what the attackers were able to access / control.\r\n\r\n**Part 2 - Secrets in source code**\r\nGitGuardian's 2022 State of Secrets Sprawl report showed more than 6 million secrets were leaked publicly through source code in 2021 on GitHub.com. This number increased again in the (yet to be released) 2023 State of Secrets Sprawl Report. We will focus specifically on how many secrets were discovered inside android projects including the total number of secrets found, common secrets discovered, and common files containing plain text secrets. \r\n\r\n**Part 3 - Secrets on the play store**\r\nThe third section will review research into how many mobile applications on the Google Play Store are leaking secrets. The research reviews nearly 50,000 apk files which were downloaded from the Play Store and decompiled to reveal how many contained secrets. We show the overwhelming percentage of apps that contained plain text secrets and the types of secrets commonly found. \r\n\r\nTogether these sections show that attackers are actively trying to find and exploit secrets in our applications and reveal two predominant ways they are getting leaked in public places. The presentation will finish with actionable steps developers can take to prevent secrets from leaking. \r\n",

      "description": "KMP is not only KMM. You can also build web and desktop apps! And Kotlin doesn’t only work for Android, as many may think. You can build a backend for your app.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for a side project or just curious, I would suggest you try backend development with Kotlin. When I was starting with KMPizza I had a number of questions:\r\n\r\n- Is it reasonable/worth it to start learning Backend development with Kotlin? May be there is something different from Kotlin? I've heard good things about Go. Or should I rather choose Java frameworks as they are more mature? \r\n \r\n- Which framework is good to choose for a beginner? Kotlin Spring probably benefits from the maturity of Java Spring, whereas I have seen and heard more about Ktor implementations. Also using Ktor in the client side in KMM may be a good addition to learning backend with Ktor. \r\n \r\n- Any tutorials/starter projects/guides/learning kits?\r\n \r\nIn this talk I’m going to share what answers I found and how I learned backend development with Kotlin.",
